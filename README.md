# ML Fundamentals Course

This course introduces fundamental machine learning algorithms and techniques, and their implementations applied to solving real world problems.

## Course Description

Topics covered include:

- Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
- Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning)

The theory of machine learning and the practical know-how lead to numerous case studies with applications in text understanding (web search, anti-spam), medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## Course Materials

The course materials consist of Jupyter Notebooks, which contain lecture notes, code examples, and exercises. These notebooks are available in the `notebooks/` directory of this repository.
